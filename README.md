PROOF
=====

###PHP Related Object Oriented Framework

PROOF is a library of PHP classes created during development of the
saferlanes web application. The library prefers maintainable object
oriented design over some of the more fanciful features of PHP.

It is meant to be a decent set of foundational classes for building small and simple web applications
when running a one man/woman show.

Enjoy!
