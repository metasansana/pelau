TODO
====

Expect the current release to be very buggy. More unit testing is necessary.

Unit Tests
----------

Not all classes will have unit tests. These are the ones not done yet:


Broken Tests
------------



Documentation
-------------

*Review comments on classes.
*Generate class docs.
*Make class docs available online.

Packaging
---------

*A .deb file would be nice.


WishList
-----------

*Number class.
*Character class.
*Platform::import() method.
*A String->trim() method that removes whatever we want.


Outstanding Fixes
-------

*Browser->redirect() needs implementation.
*HttpResponse should become a static class.
*Ensure all classes have Object as a root.
