Proof
=====

Proof is a PHP library meant to provide a more natural feel to object oriented programming in the language.
Objects are king and are used wherever possible.


Why?
----

I started this library because I was learning about OOP analysis and design around the same time I was learning
PHP. It seemed like a nice oppurtunity to learn something.

Commence the reinvention of the wheel. :)


Usage
-----

To start using proof just copy the "proof" folder and "proof.php" file to your server route.
From there just include the "proof.php" file and your on your way.
